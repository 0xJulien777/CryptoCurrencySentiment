# CryptoCurrencySentiment

## Overview

This project utilizes Streamlit to create a web application that analyzes the sentiment of cryptocurrency-related posts on Reddit.

- **Search by SubReddit:** Users can specify a subreddit and optionally filter by a keyword to analyze sentiment in posts.
- **Global Trends:** Offers an overview of the global sentiment towards cryptocurrencies based on the latest posts from selected subreddits.
